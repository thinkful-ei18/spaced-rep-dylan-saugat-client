# Spaced Repetition

A flash card application with a spaced repetition algorithm to more effectively learn Dragon Language from Skyrim. The site is deployed [here](http://spaced.nielsendb.com/) and the server repo is [here](https://github.com/thinkful-ei18/spaced-rep-dylan-saugat-server)

## Getting started

This repo is only the backend portion of the project which was worked on by Dylan Nielsen. The API has protected endpoints with JWT's passed in as Bearer tokens. The questions are stored in a linked list tied to the User and the GET /question endpoint will only return the next available question which can be answered with a POST request to /questions with an answer key in the JSON body. Depending on whether or not the answer was correct, the algorithm will shift the question to a different position in the linked list based on how many consecutive correct answers that specific question has. The questions also keep track of the statistics associated with each question.
